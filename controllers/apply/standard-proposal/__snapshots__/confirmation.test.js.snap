<h2>
  What happens next?

<p>
  Your proposal has been passed on to one of our funding officers.
</p>

  We’re now prioritising proposals for COVID-19 related projects,
so they can start sooner. And it might take us longer to get
back to you about proposals that aren’t COVID-19 related.
</p>
<p>
  If it's something we can fund, you'll be asked if
you want to make a full application.
