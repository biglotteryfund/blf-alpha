            We've emailed you a copy of what you wrote along
            with information about what happens next.
            Hold on to it in case you want to look at your answers again.
            It can be helpful to refer back to if we call.

        <h2>What happens next?</h2>
        <p>
            Your proposal has been passed on to one of our funding officers.
            We’re now prioritising proposals for COVID-19 related projects,
            so they can start sooner. And it might take us longer to get
            back to you about proposals that aren’t COVID-19 related. 
        </p>
        <p>
            If it's something we can fund, you'll be asked if
            you want to make a full application.
        </p>
        <p>Any questions in the meantime? <a href="/contact">Contact us</a></p>`,
