            We've emailed you a copy of what you wrote along
            with information about what happens next.
            Hold on to it in case you want to look at your answers again.
            It can be helpful to refer back to if we call.

        <p>
            Your idea has been passed on to one of our funding officers.
            They'll respond in around <strong>15 working days</strong>,
            to give you some advice on how likely we are to fund it and
            which programme you might apply to.
        </p>
        <p>
            If it's something we can fund, you'll be asked if
            you want to make a full application.
        </p>
        <p>Any questions in the meantime? <a href="/contact">Contact us</a></p>`
