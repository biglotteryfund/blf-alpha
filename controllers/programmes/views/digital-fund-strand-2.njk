                <h2>Digital Funding priorities</h2>
                <p>The <a href="./">Digital Funding Programme</a> is currently planning to make awards to just two kinds of organisation:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Strand 1: Long-established charities with 25 or more staff want to reassess their core activities and fundamental business models, through a digital lens. <a href="./strand-1">Learn more</a></strong></li>
                    <li><strong>Strand 2: Smaller organisations that have no ‘pre-digital’ legacy structures to modernise, which are poised to deliver impact at real scale</strong></li>
                </ul>

                <p>The Big Lottery Fund will also soon be commissioning digital experts to offer free assistance to hundreds of voluntary sector organisations looking to build their basic digital skills. The Digital Fund will therefore not be making grants that are focused on basic skills.
                <a href="./alternative-funding">You can sign up for updates about free digital assistance here.</a></p>

                <h2>Are you eligible for strand 2 funding?</h2>

                <p>With this strand of the Digital Fund we are looking to fund smaller organisations that have no ‘pre-digital’ legacy structures to modernise, which are poised to deliver impact at real scale. It can also provide <a href="./strand-1">funding for larger organisations who would like to use digital to change their core business.</a></p>
