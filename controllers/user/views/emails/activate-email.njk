        <p>Hello,</p>

        <p>
            Thanks for creating an account.
            We're looking forward to hearing about your idea to help your community thrive.
        </p>

        <h2>Before applying for fundingâ€”activate your account</h2>
        <p>This will confirm <strong>{{ emailAddress }}</strong> is your email address.</p>

        <p><a href="{{ activationUrl }}" class="btn">Activate your account</a></p>

        <p><strong>This activation link will expire at {{ expiryDate }}</strong></p>

        <p>
            If you haven't used it by then, you'll need to
            <a href="{{ loginUrl }}">log in to your account</a> to request the activation link again.
            We do this to keep your account secure.
        </p>

        <p>Thanks,<br/>The National Lottery Community Fund</p>
