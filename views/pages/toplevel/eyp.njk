        <p>We fund projects which can show us that young people are fully involved in the development, design, running and evaluation of the project.<p>

        <p><strong>Talk to us! We're really interested in your ideas.</strong> And we're here to support you to make the best application possible.</p>

        <p><strong>How have you involved young people and the community in designing your project?</strong> Show us that you've really listened to what they said.</p>

        <p><strong>Don't just listen to young people</strong>. Listen to their support networks and communities too, and show us how their aspirations are reflected in your plans.</p>

        <p><strong>It can be good to involve parents and guardians at an early stage</strong>. If they understand how you can help, they're more likely to encourage young people to get involved.</p>

        <p><strong>It's important that young people are involved in running your project</strong>. Tell us how you'll make sure their voices will be heard and their advice acted on.</p>

        <p><strong>We want to back projects that suit all kinds of young people</strong>. Include a range of interests and experience, as well as different levels of confidence and ability.</p>

        <p><strong>Show us how your project is different from others that are already out there</strong>. Or how you plan to collaborate with others who are similar.</p>
