          subTitle: £10,000–£500,000
          summaryItems:
          - Project ideas should come from the community. Talk to the people you want to help and get them involved in
            shaping and planning the project.
          - Your project should make good use of the skills, knowledge, resources and energy of people within your
            community; making it stronger and ready for the future.
          - Understand the need for your project and how it fits with the work of other organisations. Build
            relationships and work together on shared goals.

          subTitle: £10,000–£500,000
          summaryItems:
          - This funding is for projects that work with young people (8 – 25 years old), and which will run for between
            1 and 5 years.
          - "Projects will help young people to: have the skills they need for the future; have better relationships
            with their support networks and communities; and/or have improved health and wellbeing."
          - Young people must be involved in the planning and delivery of the project. They must be able to develop the
            skills to help themselves, and their support networks and communities need to be involved too.
          - Applications welcome from constituted voluntary or community organisations, and social enterprises.

        - title: Great Ideas
          subTitle: £10,000 to £500,000
          summaryItems:
          - We believe that working with people at every stage of the process helps communities to thrive.
          - However, we have learned that this approach sometimes leaves gaps for great ideas which don’t necessarily
            involve people at every stage of their development, but if implemented would contribute to putting people
            in the lead.
          - So we have developed Great Ideas to support projects like this. Projects that we could support under Great
            Ideas might include activity like testing digital approaches, developing user led approaches or developing
            community decision making.

    <h2>Events/Photo opportunities</h2>
    <p>We’d love to see photos of your project. You don’t need an expensive camera – a smart phone is perfect for capturing the moment.</p>

    <p>You can share your pictures with us on:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Facebook (<a href="https://www.facebook.com/TNLCommunityFund/">@TNLCommunityFund</a>)</li>

        <li>Instagram (<a href="https://www.instagram.com/TNLCommunityFund">@TNLCommunityFund</a>)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>If you’ve ordered a cheque, try to use a thick, dark pen and write using large handwriting, so everyone can read your organisation name and the amount you’ve been funded. This is really important if you’re going to use your cheque in photos.</p>
