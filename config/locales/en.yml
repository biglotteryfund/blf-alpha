        <p>We are proud to support the good work you do, using funding raised by National Lottery players for good causes. It's thanks to them that we give out more than £500 million to charities, community and voluntary groups each year.</p>
        <p>It's really important that people involved with your project understand that it's been supported by players of The National Lottery – putting our logo somewhere easily visible helps to do this. You can put the logo on a wall, add it to your website or a piece of equipment – anywhere where people can see it. You can download our logos below. For full guidance, see <a href="https://www.tnlcommunityfund.org.uk/media/documents/BrandGuidelines2019.pdf">our Brand Guidance (PDF, 1.4MB)</a>.</p>

    <h1>Congratulations on getting National Lottery funding</h1>

    <p>Thanks for your order. Your delivery will be with you within six working days. We know you’re excited to share the news, so here are some tips to make a big impact.</p>

    <h2>Events/Photo opportunities</h2>
    <p>We’d love to see photos of your project. You don’t need an expensive camera – a smart phone is perfect for capturing the moment.</p>

    <p>You can share your pictures with us on:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Facebook (<a href="https://www.facebook.com/TNLCommunityFund/">@TNLCommunityFund</a>)</li>
        <li>Twitter (<a href="https://twitter.com/TNLComFund">@TNLComFund</a>)</li>
        <li>Instagram (<a href="https://www.instagram.com/TNLCommunityFund">@TNLCommunityFund</a>)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>If you’ve ordered a cheque, try to use a thick, dark pen and write using large handwriting, so everyone can read your organisation name and the amount you’ve been funded. This is really important if you’re going to use your cheque in photos.</p>

    <h2>Social Media</h2>

    <p>Without National Lottery players’ support your grant wouldn’t be possible. Please say thank you to them by using #NationalLottery in your social media posts.</p>

    <p>If you’re unsure what to post, copy this example and fill in the gaps for your project.</p>

    <blockquote>Thanks to #NationalLottery players for making our project possible. We’re making a huge difference to the lives of (XXXX) people thanks to #NationalLottery funding.</blockquote>

    <p>There are lots of other ways to celebrate your funding. You can find more resources and top tips on how to promote your grant on our website: <a href="https://www.tnlcommunityfund.org.uk/welcome">www.tnlcommunityfund.org.uk/welcome</a>.</p>

    <p>If you have any questions about your order, get in touch at <a href="mailto:branding@tnlcommunityfund.org.uk">branding@tnlcommunityfund.org.uk</a>.</p>

      title: What information you need to apply
      body: >
        <h3>1. The details of two different people from your organisation</h3>
        <p>One person should be someone we can talk to if we have any questions about your project. The other should  be a senior member of your organisation, who’ll be legally responsible for the funding. Both need to live in the UK.</p>
        <p><strong>The two people can’t:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>be related by blood</li>
            <li>be married to each other</li>
            <li>be in a long-term relationship with each other</li>
            <li>use the same email address in your application form</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>What details you’ll need:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>names, email addresses, telephone numbers</li>
            <li>home addresses</li>
            <li>dates of birth</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>2. Details about your organisation</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>The legal name of your organisation</li>
            <li>Your organisation’s address</li>
            <li>What type of organisation it is (for example, a registered charity or not-for-profit company)</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>3. Your organisation’s accounts</h3>
        <p><strong>We want to know the date your accounts end each year.</strong><br/> And how much income you have.</p>
        <p>
            <strong>If you don’t have yearly accounts (because your organisation is less than 15 months old).</strong><br/>
            That’s okay. We can still look at your application.
        </p>
        <h3>4. A bank statement from the last 3 months</h3>
        <p>It should show:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>your organisation’s legal name</li>
            <li>address the statements are sent to</li>
            <li>your bank’s name</li>
            <li>the account code and sort number</li>
            <li>date the statement was issued.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Here’s <a href="/assets/images/apply/under-10k-bank-statement-example.png">a handy picture of the kind of bank statement we’re looking for.</a></p>
        <h3>5. We ask for information about what sort of project you’d like to do</h3>
        <p>And how your project will help and involve your community.</p>
        <h3>6. We also ask you to read and agree to our terms and conditions</h3>
        <p>You can have a <a href="/media/documents/awards-for-all/terms%20and%20conditions/TF19_043_Awards-for-All_Terms-and-Conditions_ENGLAND-0.1.pdf">look at the terms and conditions here</a>.</p>
