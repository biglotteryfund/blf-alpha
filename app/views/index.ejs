<p>The value of awards we have made this year is significantly reduced from 2014/15. This is due to the timing of grant
    decisions and does not represent an on-going change in our capacity to make grant awards.</p>

<p>Last year's grant awards were unusually high due to the award of &pound;149 million to the Power to Change Trust,
    whereas this year is lower than anticipated as a result of some delays to our European matched funding property.</p>
