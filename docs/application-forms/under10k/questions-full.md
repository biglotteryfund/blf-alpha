| Text      | What would you like to do? |
| Help Text | Here are some ideas of what to tell us about your project: -What you would like to do - What difference your project will make - Who will benefit from it - How long you expect to run it for. This can be an estimate - How you'll make sure people know about it - How you plan to learn from it and use this learning to shape future projects - Is it something new, or are you continuing something that has worked well previously? We want to fund both types of projects. You can write up to 300 words for this section, but don't worry if you use less.              |

| Help Text | With the COVID-19 pandemic still with us, we'll continue to support people and communities most adversely impacted by COVID-19. We can support you to: - continue to deliver activity - whether your community needs crisis response, recovery or business as usual activity - change and adapt, becoming more resilient to respond to new and future challenges. In order to support communities to thrive, we aim to: - build strong relationships in and across communities - improve the places and spaces that matter to communities - help more people to reach their potential, by supporting them at the earliest possible stage. - You can write up to 150 words for this section, but don't worry if you use less.|

| Help Text | What do we mean by community? 1. People living in the same area 2. People who have similar interests or life experiences, but might not live in the same area 3. Even though schools can be at the heart of a community—we'll only fund schools that also benefit the communities around them. We believe that people understand what's needed in their communities better than anyone. Tell us how your community came up with the idea for your project. We want to know how many people you've spoken to, and how they'll be involved in the development and delivery of the project. **Here are some examples of how you could be involving your community:** - Having regular chats with community members, in person or on social media - Including community members on your board or committee - Regular surveys - Setting up steering groups. **You can write up to 200 words for this section, but don't worry if you use less.** |

| Help Text | If 75% or more of the people supported or benefitting from your project come from one specific group of people, that means it's for that group. -Your specific group may share more than one characteristic. When you go through this form, you can pick more than one. But 75% or more of the group should share these characteristics. -For example, if the group you’re supporting is made up of at least 75% female refugees, this would qualify as supporting a specific group - that specific group would be women who are refugees. And they'd share two characteristics - women + refugees. -This figure of 75% - or 3 in 4 people - was decided on after working with a wide range of groups. -We know this can only be an estimate. It’d be too difficult to work out exactly, especially when you will not yet know exactly who’ll benefit. |
