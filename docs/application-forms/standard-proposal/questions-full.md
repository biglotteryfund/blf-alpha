But 75% or more of the group should share these characteristics. -For example, if the group you’re supporting is made up of at least 75% female refugees, this would qualify as supporting a specific group - that specific group would be women who are refugees. And they'd share two characteristics - women + refugees. -This figure of 75% - or 3 in 4 people - was decided on after working with a wide range of groups. -We know this can only be an estimate. It’d be too difficult to work out exactly, especially when you will not yet know exactly who’ll benefit. |
