# Application forms

## How applications work

-   Applications require an account on our website.
-   A pending application must be completed within **3 months**. We send a reminder email **30 days**, **7 days** and **1 day** before the application expires after which the pending application is deleted. People can unsubscribe from these emails on a per-application basis.
-   We don't limit the number of pending applications in progress at any one time.

## User accounts

-   Any existing accounts on the previous “portal” are not available on the new system for security reasons. Anyone without an account must create a new one.
-   Passwords must meet some strength checks. We disallow passwords fewer than **10 characters**, common passwords like “password123”, and passwords that are the same as the registered email address.
-   If a user tries to register with an existing email address, we can’t tell them this directly for security reasons.
-   People get **10 log in** attempts before we lock their account for **15 minutes**.
-   Users must confirm their email address before they can start or continue an application. They will be emailed a link which expires after **three hours**. They can re-request an activation email but **only the newest one** will work.
-   Users can reset their password provided they remember their email address. The login page contains a link for them to request a password reset.
-   Users can updated their email address provided they confirm their password (and then activate the new email address).
