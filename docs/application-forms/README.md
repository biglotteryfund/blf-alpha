# Application forms

## How applications work

-   Applications require an account on our website.
-   A pending application must be completed within **3 months**. We send a reminder email **30 days**, **7 days** and **1 day** before the application expires after which the pending application is deleted. People can unsubscribe from these emails on a per-application basis.
-   We don't limit the number of pending applications in progress at any one time.
