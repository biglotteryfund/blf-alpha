# Application forms

## How applications work

- Applications require an account on our website.
- When people start a new application they must first complete a set of eligibility questions. We don't store their answers to these questions anywhere but these act as a screener before someone can start a new application.
- A pending application must be completed within **3 months**. We a send reminder email **30 days**, **7 days** and **1 day** before the application expires after which the pending applicaiton is deleted. People can unsubscribe from these emails on a per-application basis.
- We don't limit the number of pending applications in progress at any one time.
