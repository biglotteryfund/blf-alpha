# App todo

These are chores, refactoring tasks or simply reminders of code that needs to be written.

## Misc
- [ ] Add a way to highlight current section in nav?
- [ ] use production version of vue in non-dev envs
- [ ] Solution to hardcoded links in locale/lang files? 
- [ ] remove vary header?
- [ ] make mobile nav accessible without JS (and add ARIA roles)
- [ ] give SVGs a minimum size so lack of CSS doesn't break page
