# App todo

These are chores, refactoring tasks or simply reminders of code that needs to be written.

## To fix
- [ ] google tag manager / experiment for homepage?
- [ ] CSRF
- [ ] session caching issues on tools/login
- [ ] make commit hooks only run if JS code changes
- [ ] failing tests don't stop commits/builds?!

## Tech debt
- [ ] print stylesheet
- [ ] specify a db pool size
- [ ] add a way to highlight current section in nav
- [ ] use production version of vue in non-dev envs
- [ ] find solution to hardcoded links in locale/lang files 
- [ ] remove vary header
- [ ] and add ARIA roles to SVGs and mobile nav
- [ ] resize carousel height on item change

## Tests to write
 - [ ] news UD works (CR done)
 - [ ] GA is loaded
 - [ ] are form fields working as expected?
