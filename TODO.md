# App todo
These are chores, refactoring tasks or simply reminders of code that needs to be written.

## Todo / tech debt
- [ ] Refactor header markup and styles once new full-bleed version is rolled out more widely.
- [ ] Add more granular named breakpoints
- [ ] Synchronise database as a more explicit step, refactor bin/www?
- [ ] Update parameter store to use namespaces, fetch in CI?

## To think about
- [ ] find solution to hardcoded links in locale/lang files - or is this a CMS job?

## Tests to write
 - [ ] news UD works (CR done)
 - [ ] GA is loaded
 - [ ] are form fields working as expected?
