# App todo
These are chores, refactoring tasks or simply reminders of code that needs to be written.

## Todo / tech debt
- [ ] Refactor header markup and styles once new full-bleed version is rolled out more widely.
- [ ] Add more granular named breakpoints

## To think about
- [ ] CSRF: how to approach when pages are cached?
- [ ] find solution to hardcoded links in locale/lang files - or is this a CMS job?
- [ ] should we remove vary:cookie header? will this break sessions?

## Tests to write
 - [ ] news UD works (CR done)
 - [ ] GA is loaded
 - [ ] are form fields working as expected?
