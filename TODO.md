# App todo

These are chores, refactoring tasks or simply reminders of code that needs to be written.

- [ ] Refactor form input component to make input errors and values global
- [ ] Improve routing config and tie routes into language files directly
- [ ] Add a linkbuilder function
- [ ] Pre-commit hook wipes out local dev env CSS
- [ ] Once on a `/welsh` url, should all links be relative to this?
