# App todo
These are chores, refactoring tasks or simply reminders of code that needs to be written.

## Todo / tech debt
- [ ] homepage: data/application base64 JS is violating CSP (google cx api)
- [ ] homepage: google tag manager / experiment for homepage â€“ verify working
- [ ] log material orders (need legal signoff)
- [ ] Refactor header markup and styles once new full-bleed version is rolled out more widely.
- [ ] Add more granular named breakpoints
- [ ] Make .t3--a class a general modifier rather than specific to .t3

## To think about
- [ ] CSRF: how to approach when pages are cached?
- [ ] should we change desktop breakpoint to be > 1024 for ipad landscape (20% margins too big)?
- [ ] find solution to hardcoded links in locale/lang files - or is this a CMS job?
- [ ] should we remove vary:cookie header? will this break sessions?

## Tests to write
 - [ ] news UD works (CR done)
 - [ ] GA is loaded
 - [ ] are form fields working as expected?
